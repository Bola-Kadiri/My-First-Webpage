        My name is Jimoh Kadiri Bola, I am a graduate of University of University of Ibadan with five years
        experience in Marketing. I bagan my journey in IT world last year (May, 2020) with the aim of exploring 
        needed opportunities in this profession.
        However, have suceeded in learning some frontend and backend skills but I needed to upgrade my skills
        further. As a man with vission, I met with some IT expert to learn more on mastering some frontend skills
        which led me here. I am very grateful and priviledged beeing among you guys.
        Firstly, I worked with Business Day Media Limited as Sales Rep in the year 2014, after which I went for my
        Youth service 2015.
        After the completion of NYSC, I proceeded to teaching advanced Mathematics for people seeking admission and 
        those who are in their first and second year in high institution, this I did for about a year + impacting 
        knowledge to people. I left this and secure a formal job in Tafsan Investments Limited as their sales analyst
        for five year.
        Finally, I thank every member of this group for saharing part of their precious time to train us and engage us
        with real life codding experience. Big thumb up for you guy.
        God bless you all
